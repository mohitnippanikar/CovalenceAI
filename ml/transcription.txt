 In this video, I am going to magically shrink myself, like a trillion times smaller and  I am going to enter this atom.  Let's explore what's in this tiny particle.  Hi friends, I am sure you have heard the word atom in chemistry, it's a very tiny particle.  Here, I have a model of an atom.  real atom is so tiny that we can't even see it, before I become really tiny and we  go on a journey inside the atom, let me ask you what does the word atom mean? It's derived  from the Greek word atomos, meaning indivisible because they thought that the atom is the  smallest particle and it cannot be divided further. But now we know that's not true.  Scientists such as Thompson, Rutherford and Chadwick, they discovered subatomic particles.  I have a video on Thompson's and Rutherford's model of an atom.  In this video, I compare the structure of an atom to a frigid spinner, so do check it out.  All right friends, wish me luck because I am going to shrink myself like a trillion  times smaller, and we-  We are going to go inside the atom.  All right, we are inside the atom now.  The atom looks mostly empty, hollow, wait a minute.  I can see some tiny particles spinning around here.  There's also something in the center.  This looks like a model of the solar system with the sun in the center and the planets spinning  around it.  Now let's look at each one.  part in detail. The tiny particles spinning around the center are called electrons. These  are negatively charged particles and they have a very small mass. The electrons were  discovered by J.J. Thomson using the cathode ray tube experiment. Can you see that there  is something in the center of the atom? Remember rather forth's model of the atom, he  called the center.  nucleus. The nucleus is very tiny, but holds almost the entire mass of the atom. So,  let's zoom into the nucleus and let's see what's inside it. As you can see, there are  two types of particles in the nucleus. Protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged  particles and neutrons are neutral.  have no charge. It's easy to remember, P for proton, P for positive and neutron sounds  like neutral. They have zero charge. Now do you know what are the protons and neutrons  collectively known as? That's right, nucleons because they are in the nucleus of the atom.  The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are much heavier.  compared to the light electrons here. The mass of each proton or neutron is approximately  2000 times the mass of an electron. So almost the entire mass of the atom is sitting in the  nucleus here. The atom has this very heavy nucleus with the light electrons spinning around it.  It is just like the solar system with a very heavy sun and  light planets spinning around it. Now, do you know what is in the space between the nucleus  and the electrons? Again, it is just like the solar system. This is just empty space,  it is just vacuum. But there was a problem with rather  force model of an atom. The electrons revolving around the nucleus could radiate energy.  This means the electrons would lose energy.  energy and finally fall into the nucleus. So the atom would collapse. Then everything  around us should collapse. But we know that's not true. The atom is stable. So Bohr proposed  a new model of an atom to correct this. According to Bohr's model of an atom, the electrons  can revolve only in certain orbits where they do not radiate energy.  So the atom is stable.  It is just like the solar system where the planets revolve around the sun in fixed orbits.  So let us take a look at Bohr's model of the atom.  The fixed orbits in an atom are known as electron shells.  The shells are numbered starting from the inner motion.  So it is 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on.  They are labeled usingâ€¦  letters starting with the letter K. So, it is K, L, M, N and so on. Now, you may be  wondering why do they start with the letter K? Why is it not A? Well, there is an interesting  story behind this. I would encourage you to find it yourself and do let me know what you  found by putting it in the comments below. Now, let us say an atom has 6 electrons  So, how would you arrange the electrons in these different shells?  Can we just put them randomly in any shell?  The answers?  No.  There are certain rules for filling in the electrons in the shells of an atom.  These rules are known as Bohr Berry's rules.  So, let us go ahead and take a look at these rules.  We will start with carbon.  The carbon atom has 6 electrons.  Let us fill in the electrons according to Bohr Berry's rules. The first shell can hold  the maximum of 2 n square. So, that is 2 electrons. So, let us go ahead and put 2 electrons  in the first shell. Now, how many electrons are we left with? We have 4 electrons. The  second shell here can hold the maximum of 2 n square. So, that is 8 electrons.  So, we can put all the 4 electrons in our second shell.  The second shell is the outermost shell and it does not have more than 8 electrons.  So, these shells are following bore berries rules and this is the electron configuration  diagram of carbon.  We can write it in shot as 2 comma 4 because the first shell the k shell has 2 electrons  and the second shell, the outermost shell, the other  shell has 4 electrons. Next, let us look at chlorine. The chlorine atom has 17 electrons.  Again, we will apply bore berries rules. The first shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.  So let us put in 2 electrons in the first shell. Now, we are left with 15 electrons. The  second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons.  So, let us fill in 8 electrons in the second shell and we are now left with 7 electrons.  The third shell can hold the maximum of 2 n squared, so that is 2 into 3 squared which  is 18 electrons.  So, we can put in all the remaining 7 electrons in the third shell.  The third shell is the outer motion and it does not have more than 8 electrons.  followed here. This is our electron configuration diagram of chlorine. And in short, we can write  it as 2 comma 8 comma 7. Next, let us try calcium. The calcium atom has 20 electrons. This time,  why do not you pause the video here and try to get the electron configuration yourself?  So, what did you get?  The correct answer is 2, 8, 8, 8, 2.  Isn't it simply amazing that the design of the solar system and the atom are pretty similar?  The solar system is this gigantic thing and the atom is a very, very tiny particle.  But they both have a heavy centre with light things revolving around the centre.  And the space in between is just...  and do check out the full courses for physics, chemistry, biology, maths and computer  coding on our website www.manuchaacademy.com. I'll put the links below.
