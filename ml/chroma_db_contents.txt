Content: In the past few years, we have seen changes to the world-wealth ranking.  We've seen top-name switch positions like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.  Today we're going to talk about the richest man in Asia.  Gautam Adani.  How he went from being a college dropout to one of the richest men in the world.  Part 1 The Son of a Textile Merchant.  Tom Adami was born on the 24th of June in 1962, to his parents Shanti Lal Adani and  Shanti Ben Adani.  He was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in India, and he was raised alongside his seven siblings.  Gautam's family migrated from the northern part of Gujarat, and his father provided for  the family through his small textile merchandise.  Hoping for a brighter future for his children, Shanti Lal Adani ensured that his children  were educated.  Kattam's father insisted on education for his children.  Kattam developed a passion for trading.  This influence came from watching his father, who was emergent.  However, he was not interested in the family business.

After he graduated, he excelled in university, studying to get a bachelor's degree in commerce.  While Kattam was studying, he couldn't ignore his desire to practice trading.  rather than just studying about it in class.  He visited Gujarat's candler port,  while he was a student, and his dream expanded.  Gautam decided he would also build something  like Goudrad's candler port or something bigger.  After his second year at the university,  he dropped out to follow his passion.  Gautam was still a teenager when he dropped out of school,  but he was inspired to set up a business for himself.  However, Gautam wanted to do something different  from selling textiles, which his father had done.  for most of his life. His family was economically challenged by having to take care of seven children  and

Gautam, however, had his eyes  on a business he was sure would change his life. And that was the diamond brokerage business.  Part 2. Life After College  The diamond business in Mumbai was thriving at the time, so Gautam felt that was the place  he needed to be. In 90  1978, Gattam moved to Mumbai to work as a diamond-sorter for Mahindra brothers after dropping  out of college as a teenager. He worked for them for two to three years before he understood  how to thrive in the market. Gattam was young and an amateur, but he was able to master  the tricks of the business in just three years. He used his knowledge of the diamond trade  to set up his diamond brokerage firm. Although it was his first business, Gattam thrived  even more than an older firm.  When Gautam was 20 years old, he made his first million from selling diamonds.

Gautam continued the diamond brokerage business, but his next breakthrough came when his elder brother,  Mahasuke Adani, purchased a plastic factory in Ahmedabad.  Mahasuke called his brother back from Mumbai and asked him to work as an operations manager for his plastic factory.  In 1981, Gautam accepted his brother's offer.  and returned to Ahmedabad. He considered his new job as his gateway to the global trade arena.  He joined his brother's firm and began importing polyvinyl chloride to India.  However, Gautam did not focus on the imports for his brother's business alone.  In 1985, he started importing primary polymers for small-scale industries,  adding global trading skills to his portfolio while in his early 20s.  Part 3, the creation of the  Adani Group.

When Gatam started the firm, he wanted to focus on imports and exports of  agricultural and power-related commodities. But a few years later, the economy of India began  to change. In 1991, India was in a macroeconomic crisis.  And to get out of it, the finance minister, Menmohan Singh, proposed new economic reforms  for the country called the Economic Liberalization Policies.  The new policy abolished industrial licensing, reduced import tariffs, and encouraged  foreign investment and privatization of various industries.  These changes were very favorable towards Gautam's new company, Adani Enterprises.  Gautam began expanding his businesses into the trading of metals, textiles.  and agro-products.

The atom is stable. So Bohr proposed  a new model of an atom to correct this. According to Bohr's model of an atom, the electrons  can revolve only in certain orbits where they do not radiate energy.  So the atom is stable.  It is just like the solar system where the planets revolve around the sun in fixed orbits.  So let us take a look at Bohr's model of the atom.

How Important are Dates?
There was a time when historians were 
fascinated with dates. There were heated 
debates about the dates on which rulers 
were crowned or battles were fought. In 
the common-sense notion, history was 
synonymous with dates. You may have 
heard people say, “I find history boring 
because it is all about memorising 
dates.” Is such a conception true?
History is certainly about changes 
that occur over time. It is about 
finding out how things were in the 
past and how things have changed. 
As soon as we compare the past with 
the present, we refer to time, we talk of 
“before” and “after”. 
Living in the world we do not always 
ask historical questions about what 
we see around us. We take things for 
granted, as if what we see has always 
been in the world we inhabit. But most of 
us have our moments of wonder, when we are 
curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical.

Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall, 
you may wonder – when did people begin to drink tea or 
coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask 
yourself – when were railways built and how did people 
travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading 
the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know 
how people got to hear about things before newspapers 
began to be printed.

An enthusiastic supporter 
of British conquest of India, 
Rennel saw preparation of maps 
as essential to the process of 
domination. The picture here 
tries to suggest that Indians 
willingly gave over their ancient 
texts to Britannia – the symbol of 
British power – as if asking her 
to become the protector of Indian 
culture.

All such historical questions refer us back to 
notions of time. But time does not have to be always 
precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. 
Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates 
to processes that happen over a period of time. People 
in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they 
developed a taste for it over time. There can be no 
one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, 
we cannot fix one single date on which British rule 
was established, or the national movement started, or 
changes took place within the economy and society. All 
these things happened over a stretch of time. We can 
only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over

which particular changes became visible.
Why, then, do we continue to associate history with 
a string of dates? This association has a reason. There 
was a time when history was an account of battles and big 
events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians 
wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he 
married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a 
particular war, the year he died, and the year the next 
ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, 
specific dates can be determined, and in histories such 
as these, debates about dates continue to be important. 
As you have seen in the history textbooks of the past 
two years, historians now write about a host of other 
issues, and other questions. They look at how people 
earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how 
cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms 
were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures

Which dates?
By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as 
important? The dates we select, the dates around which 
we compose our story of the past, are not important 
on their own. They become vital because we focus on 
a particular set of events as important. If our focus of 
study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a new 
set of dates will appear significant. 
Consider an example. In the histories written by 
British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-
General was important. These histories began with the 
rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, 
and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In 
separate chapters, we read about the deeds of others  — 
Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning,

was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor- 
Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books 
were linked to these personalities – to their activities, 
policies and achievements. It was as if there was nothing 
outside their lives that was important for us to know. The 
chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of 
the history of British India.

the history of British India. 
Can we not write about the history of this period in a 
different way? How do we focus on the activities of different 
groups and classes in Indian society within the format of 
this history of Governor-Generals? 
When we write history, or a story, we divide it into 
chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter 
some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes 
some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus 
only on those events that help us to give shape to the story 
we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life 
of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians 
simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we 
do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This 
would mean that the old dates will no longer have the 
significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become 
more important for us to know.

How do we periodise? 
In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political 
philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, 
A History of British India. In this, he divided Indian 
history into three periods – Hindu, Muslim and British. 
This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can 
you think of any problem with this way of looking at 
Indian history?
Why do we try and divide history into different periods? 
We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of 
a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the 
terms through which we periodise – that is, demarcate 
the difference between periods – become important. They 
reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see 
the significance of the change from one period to the next.

British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure 
the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For 
India was not capable of progress without British help.
In this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces 
of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was 
one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?
In any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu” 
or “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously 
in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only 
through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to 
suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really 
matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient 
India did not all share the same faith.

periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the 
modern period was associated with the growth of all the  
forces of modernity – science, reason, democracy, liberty 
and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society 
where these features of modern society did not exist. Can 
we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern 
period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in 
this book, under British rule people did not have equality, 
freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic 
growth and progress.
Many historians therefore refer to this period as ‘colonial’.

Administration produces records
One important source is the official records of the British 
administration. The British believed that the act of writing 
was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, 
agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once 
this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. 
This conviction produced an administrative culture of 
memos, notings and reports. 
The British also felt that all important documents 
and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they 
set up record rooms attached to all administrative 
institutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, 
the commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, 
the lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised 
institutions like archives and museums were also 
established to preserve important records.

of the administration to another in the early years                       
of the nineteenth century can still be read in the 
archives. You can also study the notes and reports 
that district officials prepared, or the instructions 
and directives that were sent by officials at the top to 
provincial administrators. 
In the early years of the nineteenth century, these 
documents were carefully copied out and beautifully 
written by calligraphists – that is, by those who specialised 
in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the 
nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple 
copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each 
government department.

Surveys become important
The practice of surveying also became common under 
the colonial administration. The British believed that 
a country had to be properly known before it could be 
effectively administered. 
By the early nineteenth century, detailed surveys 
were being carried out to map the entire country.  In 
the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The 
effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, 
the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the 
cropping pattern – all the facts seen as necessary 
to know about to administer the region. From the 
end of the nineteenth century, Census operations 
were held every ten years. These prepared detailed 
records of the number of people in all the provinces

From this vast corpus of records we can get to know 
a lot, but we must remember that these are official 
records. They tell us what the officials thought, what

they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve 
for posterity. These records do not always help us 
understand what other people in the country felt, and what 
lay behind their actions. 
For that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to 
search for these other sources, we find them in plenty, 
though they are more difficult to get than official records. 
We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and 
travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and 
popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As 
printing spread, newspapers were published and issues 
were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to

All these sources, however, were produced by those who 
were literate. From these, we will not be able to understand 
how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and 
the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the 
streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. 
Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. 
When you read this book, you will see how this can  
be done.

Images need to be carefully studied for they project the viewpoint 
of those who create them. This image can be found in several 
illustrated books produced by the British after the 1857 rebellion. 
The caption at the bottom says: “Mutinous sepoys share the loot”. 
In British representations, the rebels appear as greedy, vicious and 
brutal. You will read about the rebellion in Chapter 5.

Newspapers provide

of  a  police strike in 1946.
More than 2000 
policemen in Delhi 
refused to take their 
food on Thursday 
morning as a protest 
against their low 
salaries and the                   
bad quality of food 
supplied to them                 
from the Police Lines 
kitchen.
As the news spread               
to the other police 
stations, the men 
there also refused to 
take food … One of 
the strikers said: “The 
food supplied to us 
from the Police Lines 
kitchen is not fit for 
human consumption. 
Even cattle would                  
not eat the chappattis 
and dal which we                  
have to eat.”
