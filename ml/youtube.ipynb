      "Atomic Structure Proton, Electron and Neutron Before starting the lecture, click on the subscribe button and get access to our hundred of conceptual lectures for free. Well, we know that everything is made up of atoms. For example, consider salt, sugar and water, they all are made up of atoms. Even plants, animals and human beings are also made up of atoms. Now the important question is, what makes up atoms? Well, there are three tiny particles that make up atoms, Proton, Electron and Neutron. Remember that the shape of any atom is spherical like a ball. The structure of all atoms is the same, there is a dense central part in any atom known as a nucleus. Secondly, there are fixed parts around the nucleus known as energy levels or shells. The protons and neutrons live in the nucleus, while electrons are revolving around the nucleus just like planets revolve around the sun. Here is one of the important questions that why electrons revolve around the nucleus? Or what causes electron to revolve around the nucleus? Well, remember that proton is a positively charged particle and electron is a negatively charged particle, there is electrostatic force between them. As a result of this force, electrons constantly revolve around the nucleus. Now what about neutrons? Well, neutron is a neutral particle, it means it doesn't carry either positive or negative charge. Now let me teach you, an atom as a whole is a neutral particle. For example, consider a hydrogen atom. We know that there is only one proton in the nucleus of hydrogen and only one electron that is revolving around the nucleus. So we can write proton is equal to positive 1 because protons are positively charged particles. And we can write electron is equal to negative 1 because electrons are negatively charged particles. We know that positive 1 and negative 1 cancel out each other, thus this single positive proton neutralize this single negative electron. From this example, we learn that number of protons is equal to number of electrons in any atom. Let me repeat it, number of protons is equal to number of electrons in any atom. Thus we therefore say that an atom as a whole is a neutral particle. Now let me teach you something amazing that happens when the number of protons and electrons increase inside the atom. Let consider the helium atom. We know that there are two protons in the nucleus of helium and two electrons that are revolving in the first shell. Now let me ask you, these two protons have same charge, I mean positive charge. Are they repelling each other? Well, the answer is absolute yes. According to physics conventions, like charges repel each other. If they repel each other, then the structure of nucleus will get disturbance, which is not acceptable. Can you guess something? Well, here comes the part of neutrons. As I told you that neutrons are electrically neutral particle. Two neutrons in the helium nucleus come in action and separate this positive proton from this positive proton. You can also learn the function of neutrons in the nucleus as, consider two current-carrying wires touching each other, but they are protected by the plastic insulation. Similarly, these neutrons act as a plastic insulation between or among positively charged protons. So by this way, repulsion among positively charged protons are minimized inside any atom. Secondly, consider an atom of lithium. There are three protons in the nucleus of lithium atom and there are three electrons revolving around the nucleus. Just like protons, electrons also repel one another. But there is not only one shell or energy level in the lithium atom, there are two shells or two energy levels in the lithium atom. First shell can hold only two electrons. Thus this electron will jump into the second shell. In the second shell, a second energy level is bigger than the first shell and can accommodate up to eight electrons. Also we know that there are different energy levels like K, L, M and N. So by this way, repulsion among negative charges are minimized. To summarize my lecture, we learned that an atom is made up of three tiny particles â€“ proton, electron and neutron. Secondly, we learned that an atom as a whole is electrically neutral because the number of protons is equal to number of electrons. Thirdly, we learned that neutron minimize the internal repulsion among protons in the nucleus. Finally, we learned that an atom consists of many shells to reduce the internal repulsion among electrons. This was all about atomic structure, proton, electron and neutron.\n"

       "\" In this video, I'm going to magically shrink myself, like a trillion times smaller, and I'm going to enter this atom. Let's explore what's in this tiny particle. Hi friends, I'm sure you've heard the word atom in chemistry. It's a very tiny particle. Here, I have a model of an atom. The real atom is so tiny that we can't even see it. Before I become really tiny, and we go on a journey inside the atom, let me ask you, what does the word atom mean? It's derived from the Greek word atomos, meaning indivisible. Because they thought that the atom is the smallest particle, and it cannot be divided further. But now we know that's not true. Scientists such as Thomson, Rutherford, and Chadwick, they discovered sub-atomic particles. I have a video on Thomson's and Rutherford's model of an atom. In this video, I compare the structure of an atom to a fidget spinner. So do check it out. All right friends, wish me luck, because I'm going to shrink myself like a trillion times smaller. And we are going to go inside the atom. All right, we are inside the atom now. The atom looks mostly empty. Hello. Wait a minute, I can see some tiny particles spinning around here. There's also something in the center. This looks like a model of the solar system with the sun in the center and the planets spinning around it. Now let's look at each part in detail. The tiny particles spinning around the center are called electrons. These are negatively charged particles, and they have a very small mass. The electrons were discovered by J.J. Thomson using the cathode rate tube experiment. Can you see that there's something in the center of the atom? Remember, Rutherford's model of the atom? He called the center the nucleus. The nucleus is very tiny, but holds almost the entire mass of the atom. So let's zoom into the nucleus and let's see what's inside it. As you can see, there are two types of particles in the nucleus. Protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles, and neutrons are neutral. They have no charge. It's easy to remember. P for proton, P for positive, and neutrons sounds like neutral. They have zero charge. Now do you know what are the protons and neutrons collectively known as? That's right, nucleons, because they're in the nucleus of the atom. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are much heavier compared to the light electrons here. The mass of each proton or neutron is approximately 2,000 times the mass of an electron. So almost the entire mass of the atom is sitting in the nucleus here. The atom has this very heavy nucleus with the light electrons spinning around it. It's just like the solar system with a very heavy sun and light planets spinning around it. Now do you know what's in the space between the nucleus and the electrons? Again, it's just like the solar system. This is just empty space. It's just vacuum. But there was a problem with the rather force model of an atom. The electrons revolving around the nucleus would radiate energy. This means the electrons would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. So the atom would collapse. Then everything around us should collapse. But we know that's not true. The atom is stable. So bore proposed a new model of an atom to correct this. According to bore's model of an atom, the electrons can revolve only in certain orbits. They do not radiate energy. So the atom is stable. It's just like the solar system where the planets revolve around the sun in fixed orbits. So let's take a look at bore's model of the atom. The fixed orbits in an atom are known as electron shells. The shells are numbered starting from the inner motion shell. So it's 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. Or they're labeled using letters starting with the letter K. So it's K, L, M, N and so on. Now you may be wondering why do they start with the letter K? Why is it not A? Well, there's an interesting story behind this. I would encourage you to find it yourself. And do let me know what you found by putting it in the comments below. Now let's say an atom has 6 electrons in it. So how would you arrange the electrons in these different shells? Can we just put them randomly in any shell? The answers? No. There are certain rules for filling in the electrons in the shells of an atom. These rules are known as bore berries rules. So let's go ahead and take a look at these rules. We will start with carbon. The carbon atom has 6 electrons. Let's fill in the electrons according to bore berries rules. The first shell can hold the maximum of 2 n squared. So that's 2 electrons. So let's go ahead and put 2 electrons in the first shell. Now how many electrons are we left with? We have 4 electrons. The second shell here can hold the maximum of 2 n squared. So that's 8 electrons. So we can put all the 4 electrons in our second shell. The second shell is the automoshell and it doesn't have more than 8 electrons. So these shells are following bore berries rules. And this is the electron configuration diagram of carbon. We can write it in short as 2,4 because the first shell, the case shell has 2 electrons. And the second shell, the L shell has 4 electrons. Next, let's look at chlorine. The chlorine atom has 17 electrons. Again, we'll apply bore berries rules. The first shell can hold the maximum of 2 electrons. So let's put in 2 electrons in the first shell. Now we are left with 15 electrons. The second shell can hold the maximum of 8 electrons. So let's fill in 8 electrons in the second shell. And we are now left with 7 electrons. The third shell can hold the maximum of 2 n squared. So that's 2 into 3 squared, which is 18 electrons. So we can put in all the remaining 7 electrons in the third shell. The third shell is the automoshell and it does not have more than 8 electrons. So bore berries rules are being followed here. This is our electron configuration diagram of chlorine. And in short, we can write it as 2,8,7. Next, let's try calcium. The calcium atom has 20 electrons. This time, why don't you pause the video here and try to get the electron configuration yourself. So what did you get? The correct answer is 2,8,8,2. Isn't it simply amazing that the design of the solar system and the atom are pretty similar? The solar system is this gigantic thing and the atom is a very, very tiny particle. But they both have a heavy center with light things revolving around the center. And the space in between is just vacuum. And do check out the full courses for physics, chemistry, biology, maths and computer coding on our website. ManujaCardemy.com. I'll put the links below.

       "\" Apache Spark, an open-source data analytics engine that can process massive streams of data from multiple sources like an octopus juggling chain saws. It was created in 2009 by Matae Zaharia at UC Berkeley's AMP lab. Around this time, the amount of data being collected on the internet was exploding from megabytes to petabytes, making it impossible to analyze on a single machine. But there was already a clever programming model called MapReduce. You map data into key value pairs, shuffle and sort them into groups by key, then reduce each group to computer final result. It disallowed large data sets to be distributed across multiple machines, but there was still a huge bottleneck caused by disk I.O. Apache Spark fixed this by doing most of its work in memory instead of reading from disk, which can be up to 100 times faster. And that's a game changer for big data analytics and machine learning. It's used by Amazon to analyze e-commerce data by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab to analyze deep space, along with 80% of Fortune 500 companies to process all their data. Despite its reputation for distributed big data processing, you can easily run Apache Spark locally on your own machine. It's written in Java and runs on the JVM, but its APIs can be used with wrappers for Python, SQL and many other languages. To get started, install it, then let's imagine we have a CSV file with four columns for city population, latitude and longitude, and our boss wants us to find the city with the biggest population between the tropics. The first step is to initialize a session and then load the data into memory. The Spark will take the spreadsheet and create a data frame, which turns the columns and rows into a collection of objects that can be processed across distributed nodes. From here we can apply transformations to the data frame by chaining method calls. Like in this case, we want to filter the data frame to exclude cities outside of the tropics. That transformation will happen in memory, then we can order the results by population. And finally, use first to grab the largest tropical city, the city of Mexico City. It's pretty cool, and if you're working with a SQL database, you can easily use that data directly instead of the data frame API. And when working with massive datasets, a Spark's cluster manager or tools like Kubernetes can scale this workload horizontally across an unlimited number of machines. But when it comes to machine learning, Spark also has a secret weapon called MLlib. Let's build a predictive model by first bringing in vector assembler to merge multiple columns into a vector column. Then we can split it up into training and testing data frames. From there, Spark has a wide variety of different algorithms to handle classification, regression, clustering, and so on, all of which can be trained in a distributed system. Congratulations! You can now train large-scale machine learning models. This has been Apache Spark in 100 seconds. But before one can truly harness the full potential of Spark, one must have a solid foundation and math and problem solving, and you can start building that foundation for free right now. Thanks to this video sponsor, Brilliant. Brilliant's platform will introduce you to essential programming concepts, but most importantly, the hands-on exercises will develop your brain to recognize and solve complex problems that developers need to overcome on a daily basis.

      " In this video, I am going to magically shrink myself like a trillion times smaller and I am going to enter this atom. Let's explore what's in this tiny particle. Hi friends, I am sure you have heard the word atom in chemistry. It is a very tiny particle. Here I have a model of an atom. The real atom is so tiny that we can't even see it. Before I become really tiny and we go on a journey inside the atom, let me ask you what does the word atom mean. It's derived from the Greek word atomos, meaning indivisible because they thought that the atom is the smallest particle and it cannot be divided further. But now we know that's not true. Scientists such as Thomson, Rutherford and Chadwick, they discovered subatomic particles. I have a video on Thomson's and Rutherford's model of an atom. In this video, I compare the structure of an atom to a fidget spinner. So do check it out. All right friends, wish me luck because I am going to shrink myself like a trillion times smaller and we are going to go inside the atom. All right, we are inside the atom now. The atom looks mostly empty. Hello. Wait a minute. I can see some tiny particles spilling around here. There's also something in the center. This looks like a model of the solar system with the sun in the center and the planets spinning around it. Now let's look at each part in detail. The tiny particles spinning around the center are called electrons. These are negatively charged particles and they have a very small mass. The electrons were discovered by Jayjit Thomson using the cathode ray tube experiment. Can you see that there's something in the center of the atom? Remember Rutherford's model of the atom? He called the center the nucleus. The nucleus is very tiny but holds almost the entire mass of the atom. So let's zoom into the nucleus and let's see what's inside it. As you can see, there are two types of particles in the nucleus. Protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles and neutrons are neutral. They have no charge. It's easy to remember. P for proton, P for positive and neutrons sounds like neutral. They have zero charge. Now do you know what are the protons and neutrons collectively known as? That's right. Neucleons because they are in the nucleus of the atom. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are much heavier compared to the light electrons here. The mass of each proton or neutron is approximately 2,000 times the mass of an electron. So almost the entire mass of the atom is sitting in the nucleus here. The atom has this very heavy nucleus with the light electrons spinning around it. It's just like the solar system with a very heavy sun and light planets spinning around it. Now do you know what's in the space between the nucleus and the electrons? Again, it's just like the solar system. This is just empty space. It's just vacuum. But there was a problem with Rutherford's model of an atom. The electrons revolving around the nucleus would radiate energy. This means the electrons would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. So the atom would collapse. Then everything around us should collapse. But we know that's not true. The atom is stable. So Bohr proposed a new model of an atom to correct this. According to Bohr's model of an atom, the electrons can revolve only in certain orbits, where they do not radiate energy. So the atom is stable. It's just like the solar system, where the planets revolve around the sun in fixed orbits. So let's take a look at Bohr's model of the atom. The fixed orbits in an atom are known as electron shells. The shells are numbered starting from the innermost shell. So it's 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. Or they're labeled using letters, starting with the letter K. So it's KL, M, N and so on. Now you may be wondering, why do they start with the letter K? Why is it not A? Well there's an interesting story behind this. I would encourage you to find it yourself. And do let me know what you found by putting it in the comments below. Now let's say an atom has 6 electrons in it. So how would you arrange the electrons in these different shells? Can we just put them randomly in any shell? The answers no. There are certain rules for filling in the electrons in the shells of an atom. These rules are known as Bohr-Berry's rules. So let's go ahead and take a look at these rules. We will start with carbon. The carbon atom has 6 electrons. Let's fill in the electrons according to Bohr-Berry's rules. The first shell can hold the maximum of 2n squared. So that's 2 electrons. So let's go ahead and put 2 electrons in the first shell. Now how many electrons are we left with? We have 4 electrons. The second shell here can hold the maximum of 2n squared. So that's 8 electrons. So we can put all the 4 electrons in our second shell. The second shell is the outermost shell and it doesn't have more than 8 electrons. And these shells are following Bohr-Berry's rules. And this is the electron configuration diagram of carbon. We can write it and shot as 2,4 because the first shell, the case shell has 2 electrons. And the second shell, the L shell has 4 electrons. Next let's look at chlorine. The chlorine atom has 17 electrons. Again we'll apply Bohr-Berry's rules. The first shell can hold the maximum of 2 electrons. So let's put in 2 electrons in the first shell. Now we are left with 15 electrons. The second shell can hold the maximum of 8 electrons. So let's fill in 8 electrons in the second shell. And we are now left with 7 electrons. The third shell can hold the maximum of 2n squared. So that's 2 into 3 squared which is 18 electrons. So we can put in all the remaining 7 electrons in the third shell. The third shell is the outermost shell and it does not have more than 8 electrons. So Bohr-Berry's rules are being followed here. This is our electron configuration diagram of chlorine. And in short we can write it as 2,8,7. Next let's try calcium. The calcium atom has 20 electrons. This time why don't you pause the video here and try to get the electron configuration yourself. So what did you get? The correct answer is 2,8,8,2. Isn't it simply amazing that the design of the solar system and the atom are pretty similar? The solar system is this gigantic thing and the atom is a very very tiny particle. But they both have a heavy center with light things revolving around the center. And the space in between is just vacuum.
